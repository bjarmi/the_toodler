## Usage
To run the application all dependencies need to be installed with:
```
  npm i
```

## Device Support
The app is best viewed on Android devices but also works on IOS devices

## Extra 
The extra part that we tried to implement is a sub tasks feature.

We did not manage to finish that feature but a part of it can be viewed by pressing or long pressing on the first task under the first list which is associated with the first board.
