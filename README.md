## Usage
Please install all dependencies before executing the application by running:
```
npm i
```

To execute the application run:
```
npm start
```

## Innteractions
###Create
The green plus button at the bottom right button of each page is used to create and entity (board, list, task).

A long press on an entity card is needed to open a modal that contains a form to edit the said entity or delete it.

By pressing on a board or list card, the application will move you to a new screen containing more information about the entity.

## Device Support
The app is best viewed on Android devices but also works on IOS devices

## Extra 
The extra part that we tried to implement is a sub tasks feature.

We did not manage to finish that feature but a part of it can be viewed by pressing or long pressing on the first task under the first list which is associated with the first board.
